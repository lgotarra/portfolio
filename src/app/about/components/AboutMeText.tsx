        I&apos;m a curious and passionate developer who thrives on learning and
        solving both creative and technical challenges. With experience building
        full-stack applications, I feel most at home in collaborative,
        remote-friendly environments where adaptability and clear communication
        are essential. I have a growing interest in machine learning and
        audio/image processing, and I&apos;m always eager to explore emerging
        technologies and expand my skill set.

      <p>
        My background in telecommunications engineering has given me a strong
        foundation in technical problem-solving and systems thinking. I enjoy
        working on projects that push the boundaries of what&apos;s possible and
        allow me to apply my knowledge in innovative ways.
      </p>
      <p>
        Outside of tech, I&apos;m deeply involved in Catalan folklore and
        traditional music. I’ve been performing Ball de Bastons (stick dance)
        since I was seven, and over the years, I’ve joined several groups and
        taken on leadership roles — including seven years on the board of the
        Coordinadora de Ball de Bastons de Catalunya (Catalan Stick Dance
        Federation). I also play traditional instruments like the flabiol and
        the gralla, and I&apos;m passionate about learning the history and
        cultural significance behind these traditions.
      </p>
      <p>
        In my free time, I also enjoy photography and videography, capturing
        moments and telling stories through visuals. I find that combining
        creative and technical interests helps me approach problems from diverse
        perspectives — something I consider essential in a constantly evolving
        tech landscape.
      </p>
      {/* <p>
        I believe that my diverse interests and experiences make me a
        well-rounded individual who is always eager to learn and grow. I am
        excited to continue my journey in the tech world and contribute to
        projects that make a positive impact.
