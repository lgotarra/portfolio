Worked on a variety of full stack projects and internal tooling, combining modern web technologies with AI integration and robust testing practices:

- Developed and maintained multiple **API services** using:
  - `NestJS` with `TypeScript`
  - `Django` with `Python`
  - Integrated both **relational (`MySQL`)** and **non-relational (`MongoDB`)** databases
- Built **internal microservices** communicating via **WebSockets** and `kafka`, enabling real-time updates and event-driven workflows.
- Created **responsive web applications** built with `React.js`, prioritizing maintainability and usability for:
  - End users
  - Internal management dashboards
- Contributed to a **mobile app** for end users using `React Native`, focusing on performance and user experience.
- Improved and deployed **AI models** using [`Ultralytics`](https://www.ultralytics.com/) and monitored training progress via `TensorBoard`.
- Ensured code quality with:
  - **Unit and E2E testing** on backend services using `Jest`
  - **Frontend testing** with `Cypress` and `Playwright`
  - **Mobile testing** through `BrowserStack` and `Maestro`
- Documented APIs with `Swagger`, and broader technical documentation using `Docusaurus`√è to ensure maintainability and clarity across teams.
