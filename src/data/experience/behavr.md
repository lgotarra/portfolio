As part of a strategic partnership between companies, I contributed to the successful migration of Limbix's VR software platform. My role involved:

- 🔍 **Quality Assurance for VR applications**, testing across multiple headsets to ensure cross-device compatibility and stable performance.
- 💻 **Back-end development** using `.NET` and `C#`, collaborating within a remote, cross-functional team based in **Elizabethtown (KY)** and **Nashville (TN)**.
- 🔄 **Agile participation**, including:
  - Daily stand-ups
  - Sprint reviews
  - Retrospectives
- 🛠️ Maintained workflows via _Jira_, _Slack_, and _Bitbucket_ to streamline remote collaboration.
- 🌍 Worked remotely from **Barcelona**, occasionally visiting the local office to coordinate hardware orders and stay connected with the on-site team.
